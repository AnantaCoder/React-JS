Below is a roadmap that breaks the project down into manageable tasks, guiding you step-by-step without giving away any code:

### **Project Roadmap: Typing Speed Test App**

#### **1. Setup Your Environment**
- **Install React:** Set up a new React project using Create React App or your preferred boilerplate.
- **Project Structure:** Organize your project folders (e.g., components, hooks if needed, assets).

#### **2. Define the UI Structure**
- **Layout:** Plan the basic layout:
  - A section to display a random sentence.
  - An input field where the user types.
  - A timer and results display.
- **Styling:** Sketch a simple design or use basic CSS to ensure the UI is clear.

#### **3. Manage Component State**
- **useState:** Identify what state you need:
  - The random sentence to type.
  - The user's input text.
  - The timer count.
  - The result (words per minute) and any error state.
- **State Initialization:** Plan the initial values for these states.

#### **4. Display a Random Sentence**
- **Sentence Data:** Decide whether to hard-code a few sentences or fetch them from a local list.
- **Display Logic:** Use state to hold the current sentence and render it in your component.

#### **5. Capture User Input**
- **Input Field Setup:** Create an input field and bind it to state using `useState`.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Update the state as the user types.

#### **6. Implement Timer Functionality**
- **useEffect for Timer:** Set up a timer that starts when the user begins typing.
- **useRef for Timer ID:** Use `useRef` to store the interval ID for cleanup and performance.
- **Cleanup:** Ensure the timer is cleared properly when the component unmounts or the test resets.

#### **7. Optimize Functions with useCallback**
- **Memoized Functions:** Identify functions (like the one that handles input change or timer updates) that can benefit from memoization.
- **Prevent Re-Renders:** Use `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders, especially for functions that are passed down as props.

#### **8. Compare User Input with the Sentence**
- **Error Checking:** Write logic (using state updates within a `useEffect` if needed) to compare the user’s input with the displayed sentence.
- **Highlight Mistakes:** Plan how to visually mark the mistakes (e.g., styling the incorrect letters differently).

#### **9. Calculate Typing Speed**
- **Timing and Input Length:** Use the timer and the length of the correctly typed words to calculate words per minute (WPM).
- **Dynamic Update:** Decide when to perform this calculation (e.g., when the user completes the sentence or continuously while typing).

#### **10. Display Results and Feedback**
- **Result Section:** Create a component or section to display the WPM and highlight any mistakes.
- **Reset Option:** Add a button or mechanism to restart the test.

#### **11. Testing and Debugging**
- **Run Through Scenarios:** Test the app by simulating typing, verifying the timer works, and ensuring the error highlighting and WPM calculation are accurate.
- **Refactor as Needed:** Adjust your state management and hooks usage based on your testing results.

#### **12. Final Touches**
- **UI Enhancements:** Polish the UI with better styling and feedback messages.
- **Code Cleanup:** Ensure that your code is well-organized, with clear comments explaining your use of hooks and state management.

This breakdown will help you focus on one task at a time. As you complete each step, you’ll build confidence and gain a clearer understanding of how to use `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` effectively in React. Happy coding!
